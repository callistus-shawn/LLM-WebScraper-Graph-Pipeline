Net proceeds were **$304,633** , after transaction costs.\n  * On **April 22, 2025** , the Company completed another non-brokered private placement, issuing **1,995,829 units** at $0.21 per unit for gross proceeds of **$419,124**. Each unit included one common share and one non-transferable common share purchase warrant exercisable at $0.32 for five years.\n\n\nThe Company has raised approximately $CAN 6.3 million over the last 2 years through non-brokered private placements in support of its research and development programs. It is currently investigating the use of a full-service investment bank in the United States to advise on potential financings and US listing opportunities. Information on any future financings will be released once available in accordance with applicable securities laws.\n**Herpes Simplex Virus (“HSV”) Treatment Program**\nTheralase® continues preclinical development of its HSV treatment using non-light activated and light-activated small molecules. The Company is actively working on in-vitro, and in the near future, in-vivo HSV preclinical models to finalize a formulation for optimal dermal penetration to increase patient safety and efficacy. Good Laboratory Practice (“**GLP** “) toxicology studies will commence once a formulation has been finalized. Additional details will be announced as strategic objectives are achieved.\n**Phase II Bladder Cancer Study Update (“Study II”)**\n  * **82 patients** have been treated with the **Study Procedure** , representing approximately **91% of the total targeted enrollment** of 90 evaluable patients.\n  * **69 patients** have completed their **90-day assessment** and are considered **evaluable** for interim efficacy analysis.\n  * **13 additional patients** are pending their 90-day assessment and will be included in future efficacy updates once evaluations are complete.\n\n\n**Interim Clinical Results**\nFor the **primary endpoint** of Study II (Complete Response (“**CR** “) at any point in time) **62% of patients provided the Study Procedure** (Study Drug activated by the Study Device) **demonstrated a CR**. Including patients, who demonstrated an Indeterminate Response (“**IR** “) (negative cystoscopy and positive or suspicious urine cytology), the **Total Response (“TR”) increases to 70%**.\nThis represents that approximately 2 out of 3 BCG-Unresponsive NMIBC CIS patients treated with Theralase®’s unique Study Procedure are demonstrating complete destruction of their bladder cancer.\nFor the **secondary endpoint** of Study II (duration of CR) **42% of treated patients who achieved a CR, maintained their CR response for at least 12 months** (450 days from date of Study Procedure).\nFor the **tertiary endpoint** of Study II (safety of Study Procedure) **100% (69/69) experienced no Serious Adverse Events** (“**SAEs** “) directly related to the Study Drug or Study Device.\nOutside of the defined endpoints of Study II, Theralase® has demonstrated a duration of **CR at extended time points of 23% at 2 years, 21% at 3 years and 2% at 7 years**.\n**Note:** Not all patients have been assessed at these extended time points. As more clinical data is collected, the duration of CR at 2, 3 and 7 years may increase.\nTheralase® is on track to **complete enrollment** in Study II by the **summer of 2025**.\nThis will allow the Company to report on **75 patients who have completed Study II in December 2025** and to report on all 90 patients by September 2026.\nUpon follow-up of all patients, the Company plans to submit a **New Drug Application (“NDA”) to Health Canada and the FDA in 4Q2026** , with a decision expected by the respective regulatory authorities on a **marketing approval in 2027**.\nAs Theralase® completes enrollment in Study II, it is actively searching for commercialization partners for international marketing and sales of Ruvidar®.\nTo this end, Theralase® is in various stages of initial and advanced discussions with international pharmaceutical companies for various geographical territories concerning:\n  * Licensing of the light-activated Ruvidar® for BCG-Unresponsive NMIBC CIS\n  * Collaborative research focused on investigating light-activated Ruvidar® in the treatment of NMIBC\n  * Collaborative research focused on combining Ruvidar® with other FDA approved drugs\n\n\nIn recent discussions with the FDA, the Company has decided that since Study II is 91% complete, the best course of action is not to pursue Break Through Designation, but to complete Study II and submit the clinical data to the FDA in a formal NDA. At the end of the meeting, the FDA made a comment that they were impressed that the interim clinical data obtained to date was able to be achieved with only one clinical treatment, in the majority of cases.\nRuvidar® has demonstrated 10 years of shelf life, strongly supporting the stability of the molecule and the ability of clinics to store the small molecule for extended periods of time.\n**Additional Oncology Targets**\nTheralase® has combined Ruvidar® with transferrin (human glycoprotein) to form Rutherrin®.\nRutherrin® is a strong candidate for the systemic treatment of recurrent, deep seated and/or progressive cancers.\nDue to the limitations of using laser light to activate Rutherrin® in deep oncological targets, Theralase® plans to activate Rutherrin® with radiation therapy to increase the “tumour’s damage zone” and the effectiveness of Theralase®’s small molecule beyond the reach of light in the body.\nRutherrin®, if clinically proven, will be able to **“hunt” and “localize” into cancer cells** and when **activated by radiation “destroy” them** ; wherever, they may reside in the body.\nThe Company expects to complete Good Laboratory Practice toxicology analysis in 4Q2025 to allow commencement of a Phase 0/I/II adaptive clinical study in 1Q2026 for the following indications:\n1) Glio Blastoma Multiforme (“**GBM** “) Brain Cancer Treatment2) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“**NSCLC** “) Treatment3) Pancreatic Cancer4) Colorectal Cancer5) Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (“**MIBC** “) Treatment6) Herpes Simplex Virus (“**HSV-1** “) Topical Treatment for Cold Sore Lesions\n**For additional information** , please refer to the Company’s **Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD &A”)** available at [www.sedarplus.ca](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JgPv4fOMb1).\n**About Ruvidar®:**\nRuvidar®(TLD-1433) is a small molecule, able to be activated by light, radiation, sound and/or other drugs, intended for the safe and effective destruction of various cancers, bacteria and viruses.\n**About Theralase® Technologies Inc.:**\nTheralase® is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the research and development of light, radiation, sound and/or drug-activated small molecule compounds, their associated drug formulations and the light systems that activate them, with a primary objective of efficacy and a secondary objective of safety in the destruction of various cancers, bacteria and viruses.\nAdditional information is available at [www.theralase.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/GmkGrtVpEq) and [www.sedarplus.ca](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/QOegkhB3vw)\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n**Forward-Looking Statements:**\n_This news release contains Forward-Looking Statements (“**FLS** “) within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.

In this set of experiments, Ruvidar_ _TM_ _(1%) remained at once daily for 5 days. As can be clearly seen from the photographs, Ruvidar_ _TM_ _was successfully able to completely heal the HSV-1 lesions in an animal model; whereas, neither Abreva (10% Docosanol) nor Acyclovir (5%) were able to completely heal them. A very interesting observation from this experiment is that Ruvidar_ _TM_ _(1%) was able to completely heal the HSV-1 lesions at a fraction of the dose of the other two FDA approved drugs and completed this task with an application frequency of only once per day versus 5 times daily. My next set of experiments, in conjunction with my colleagues, and Dr. Mandel will be to optimize the formulation that will be analyzed in GLP toxicology, as well as clinically evaluated in a Phase I, II and III clinical study.”_\nArkady Mandel, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc., Chief Scientific Officer, Theralase® stated, “ _The preclinical data is what I would have predicted based on my previous research into this versatile drug; Ruvidar_ _TM_ _(1%) is superior in efficacy, when directly compared to two FDA-approved drugs; specifically: Acyclovir (5%) and Abreva (10% Docosanol). As one of the potential Mechanisms Of Action (“**MOA** “), it is well established in the literature that the glycoproteins of the HSV-1 virus (glycans—gB and gC) are negatively charged, as is the Heparan Sulphate (“**HS** “) receptors on a cell’s surface (preferred binding site of the virus on a cell). This provides a novel mechanism (based on controlled electrostatic repulsion) that addresses how viruses balance between optimized viral attachment to target cells and efficient egress of progeny virus.__3,4_ _On the other hand, Ruvidar_ _TM_ _is positively charged.__5_ _This allows Ruvidar_ _TM_ _the unique ability to be able to bind to and block the glycoproteins on HSV-1, preventing binding to host cells, as well as on the HS cell surface receptors preventing the efficient egress of progeny virus. This leads to an inability of the virus to replicate, allowing accelerated healing of cold sore lesions. The Theralase® research team is currently investigating additional MOAs to explain the ability of Ruvidar_ _TM_ _to effectively inactivate HSV-1 and to stop the progression of cold sore lesions in their tracks._ “\nRoger DuMoulin-White, B.Sc., P.Eng., Pro.Dir., President and Chief Executive Officer, Theralase® stated, “ _I am delighted with the research team’s latest set of experiments demonstrating the superiority of Ruvidar_ _TM_ _in the effective destruction of HSV-1 lesions versus Acyclovir (5%) and Abreva (10% Docosanol). Based on the success of this latest preclinical research, Theralase® will commence formulation of Ruvidar_ _TM_ _into topical form, complete GLP toxicology and commence a Phase I/II adaptive clinical study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Ruvidar_ _TM_ _in the accelerated healing of cold sore lesions in humans._ “\n**About Herpes Simplex:** Herpes Simplex Virus (“**HSV** “), known as herpes, is a very common infection that can cause painful blisters or ulcers on the skin of an individual. It primarily spreads by skin-to-skin contact, while it is treatable, it is not curable.1\nThere are two main types of HSV:1\nType 1 (“**HSV-1** “) generally spreads by oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth, vermilion, upper or lower lip region (oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes. A majority of adults are infected with HSV-1.\nType 2 (“**HSV-2** “) spreads by sexual contact and causes herpes in the genital region of an individual.\nAn estimated 3.8 billion people under the age of 50 (64%) globally have HSV-1, the main cause of oral herpes. An estimated 520 million people aged 15 to 49 (13%) globally have HSV-2, the main cause of genital herpes.1\nThe global HSV treatment market size was estimated at $USD 2.8 billion in 2024 and is expected to balloon to $USD 4.7 billion by 2033.2\n**References:** 1 [Herpes simplex virus](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/QO87oSYmAN)2 [Herpes Simplex Virus Treatment Market Size, Top Share, Key Developments | By 2033](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/m3pGWHX3nV)3 Transforms of Cell Surface Glycoproteins Charge Influences Tumor Cell Metastasis via Atypically Inhibiting Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Including Matrix Metalloproteinases and Cell Junctions.

The Company’s latest research demonstrates that radiation-activated Rutherrin® is up to 100 times more effective at destroying cancer cells than radiation therapy alone in comparable models.\nThis data will be showcased at the **2025 American Society for Radiation Oncology** (**“ASTRO”**) **67****th****Annual Meeting** , the world’s largest gathering of radiation oncology professionals, taking place in late September in San Francisco, California. ASTRO has selected the Theralase® abstract titled, “ _Rutherrin® Activated by Radiation Therapy Induces Synergistic Tumor Regression through Direct Destruction and Immune Activation in Multiple Preclinical Cancer Models_ “, for presentation in a scientific poster session.\nThe study highlights the potent anti-cancer effects of Rutherrin®—a ruthenium-based small molecule drug formulated with recombinant human transferrin for intravenous administration. Once activated by ionizing radiation through a process known as **Radio Dynamic Therapy (“RDT”)** , Rutherrin® initiates a two-phase cancer-killing response: the generation of **Reactive Oxygen Species (“ROS”)** for immediate cytotoxicity, followed by **Immunogenic Cell Death (“ICD”)** to stimulate a durable immune response.\n**Key Findings from the Preclinical Research:**\n  * **Selective Tumor Targeting** : Rutherrin® preferentially accumulates in tumor tissues, sparing healthy cells.\n  * **Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration** : Demonstrated 10x higher concentrations in Glio Blastoma Multiforme (“**GBM** “) tumors than in healthy brain tissue.\n  * **Synergistic Mechanism** : Combines direct tumor cell destruction with robust immune activation.\n  * **Improved Survival Rates** : Statistically significant survival benefits compared to radiation therapy alone.\n  * **Resistance Overcoming** : Effectively inhibits mechanisms associated with multidrug and radiation resistance.\n  * **Adaptive Immune Activation** : Induces long-term immunity, as evidenced by resistance to tumor rechallenge.\n\n\nMark Roufaiel, Ph.D., research scientist at Theralase® commented,  _“These results are highly encouraging. Rutherrin® not only enhances the effectiveness of radiation therapy, but also activates a sustained immune response, offering a powerful, dual-action strategy against aggressive and treatment-resistant cancers.”_\nArkady Mandel**,** M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc., Chief Scientific Officer of Theralase®, added,  _“Our focus is to bring this innovative platform to clinical application. Rutherrin® represents a major advancement in oncologic treatment, potentially enabling radiation oncologists to dramatically improve patient outcomes. This research provides a strong foundation for integrating Rutherrin® with existing cancer therapies to deliver more effective, long-lasting solutions.”_\nRoger DuMoulin-White, B.Sc., P.Eng., Pro.Dir., President and Chief Executive Officer of Theralase®, stated,  _“Based on this compelling data, we are fully committed to completing GLP toxicology studies in 2025. This critical milestone will support the launch of clinical studies in early 2026 targeting GBM, lung, pancreatic, lymphoma and colorectal cancers. We’re excited to continue advancing Rutherrin® toward commercialization and transforming cancer care.”_\n**About ASTRO**\nFounded in 1958, ASTRO’s mission is to advance the practice of radiation oncology by promoting excellence in patient care, providing opportunities for educational and professional development, promoting research, disseminating research results and representing radiation oncology in a rapidly evolving health care environment.\nThe ASTRO Annual Meeting is the premier event in radiation oncology, bringing together leading scientists, clinicians and industry partners to share groundbreaking research and technological innovations. The 2025 meeting in San Francisco will showcase cutting-edge advances in radiation biology, translational medicine and cancer therapeutics.\n**About Rutherrin®**\nRutherrin® is a patented formulation of Theralase®’s lead ruthenium-based small molecule (Ruvidar®) combined with recombinant human transferrin making it suitable for intravenous delivery. It has the ability to selectively accumulate in cancer cells versus healthy cells and when radiation-activated provide a one-two punch to cancer, by first destroying the cancer cell through oxidative stress and then activating the immune system for destruction of residual cancer cells. Rutherrin® is slated to enter clinical studies in early 2026 for the destruction of deadly cancers; including: brain, lung, pancreatic, colorectal and lymphoma.\n**About Theralase® Technologies Inc.**\nTheralase® is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the research and development of light, radiation, sound and/or drug-activated small molecules and their associated formulations, with a primary objective of efficacy and a secondary objective of safety in the destruction of various cancers, bacteria and viruses, with minimal impact on surrounding healthy tissue.\nAdditional information is available at [www.theralase.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/1pWWDubwG7) and [www.sedarplus.ca](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/0VRRXSPwoY).\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n_This news release contains Forward-Looking Statements (“**FLS** “) within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.

Results demonstrate a recurrence free survival (RFS) rate of 83% compared to 49% for current standard of care therapies.\nAt both 12 and 24 months, LiPax was well tolerated with no change in patient reported urinary health related quality of life, no dose limiting toxicity (grade 3 or greater severity adverse events), and no evidence of systemic exposure to paclitaxel, the active product ingredient. Patients treated with LiPax did not report adverse effects such as burning pain, discomfort, and urinary frequency associated with current standard of care treatments for NMIBC.\n“This two-year follow-up data reaffirms the results of this study’s initial readout, which is that the target tissue penetration achieved by LiPax’s precision liposomal technology has the potential to improve patient outcomes without the tolerability concerns of current standard of care therapies,” said Michael Oefelein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of LIPAC Oncology. “We look forward to advancing LiPax into Phase 2b trials this year, bringing us one step closer to providing patients in need with this innovative new treatment option.”\n“There are currently limited treatment options for low-intermediate risk NMIBC patients, and up to half of these patients will recur within two years[[1]](https://www.lipaconcology.com/june-9-2021#_ftn1),” said Neal Shore, M.D. Director of the Carolina Urologic Research Center and principal investigator for TD-001. “Current post-TURBT drug treatment regimens have shortcomings for both patients and providers, including toxicities and supply shortages, which highlights the critical need for a treatment option that can improve patient outcomes without bothersome adverse effects.”\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has agreed on Phase 2b and Phase 3 trial designs for LiPax, with the Phase 2b trial expected to initiate in Q4 2021. \n**About LiPax**\nLiPax is a precision targeted, locally delivered taxane in Phase 2b development for intravesical instillation in the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Its liposome-bound nano-technology platform achieves targeted tissue penetration with no systemic exposure, toxicity or chemo-related side-effects. NMIBC is the lead program with additional orphan indications in upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC), thoracic cancers (mesothelioma and malignant pleural effusion) and peritoneal and ovarian cancers. LiPax is designed to enhance the standard of care of outpatient endoscopic tumor removal followed by intravesical instillation using a standard urinary catheter. LIPAC Oncology completed a Phase 2a clinical trial in August 2020 and intends to initiate a Phase 2b study in the second half of 2021 to further investigate LiPax in the treatment of this condition. \n**About LIPAC Oncology LLC**\nLIPAC Oncology is a pharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development of new investigational therapies to treat intracavitary cancers. Its precision liposome-bound nano-technology platform targets local liposomal delivery of taxanes for the treatment of multiple tumor types. LiPax, its lead investigational candidate for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, is in Phase 2b development. The Company’s pipeline includes multiple orphan indications based on the established LiPax formulation.
